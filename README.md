# Demo of a population PK Workflow 

This is a demo a population PK analysis on a simulated dataset using the R packages pmworkbench, pmxplore, and NMprojectAZ. All scripts have been modified into a working example and can be re-run if you so wish. 

The R scripts were executed on the RStudio server on SCP (R v 3.4.1) and nonmem runs were submitted to slurm using NMproject functionality.
